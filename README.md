Chevereto 2.6.0

###About this repo
This is the repository of Open Source Chevereto which has been pushed from Chevereto 2.X series. This release is very stable and solid but is old and it doesn't come with support for mobile devices. If you are looking for recent versions of Chevereto (free to use) you should check [Chevereto Free](https://chevereto.com/free).

###Chevereto 2.X vs 3.X
Both systems share the same *feel* but in code terms both systems are complete different and they keep few things (or almost nothing) in common. Chevereto 3.X is the bold evolution of series 2.X which kickstarted Chevereto production development.

Chevereto 3.X comes with user accounts, galleries, responsive layout, support for multi-servers and more. Chevereto 2.X comes with a one-click uploader, an file manager and that's it.

###Features
Chevereto 2.6.0 features the following:
* Multiple image upload (flash based)
* File manager
* Password protect website
* Basic API
* Multilanguage
* Watermarks
* Flood protection
* Theme support
* Embed codes generatio
* Support for custom short URL service
* Image resizing

###Updates
Chevereto 2.6.0 actually is a very mature system and is the final release of Chevereto 2.X series. Updates will be only pushed only for security concerns and things like that.
